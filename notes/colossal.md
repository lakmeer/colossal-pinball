## Theme Ideas

### Hunt for the colossal squid

- The table is much taller than a normal table but you play one tables worth
  at a time
- Progress the game in sectors but gating each one until a mode is completed
- Each sector represents going deeper into the ocean and gets harder
- More flippers come into play as you move up the table
- Falling back down doesnt drain the ball but drops you back to an earlier
  sector, but new drains exist at weird locations in deeper zones
