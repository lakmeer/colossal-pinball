A personal experiment with PBD physics; I don't know that much about pinball.

### HowToBuildAPinballMachine / Space Eight

Any early table layout I used for testing and debugging is based on the
[Tattoo Mystique custom table by Space Eight](http://www.space-eight.com/Pinball_Tattoo_Mystique.html),
and this repo contains an early WIP layout graphic that I found at 
[How to Build a Pinball Machine](http://howtobuildapinballmachine.wordpress.com/).
Licensing was not specified, but DXF schematics and fab instructions are
provided so it seems in the spirit of open source. This table design will not
be part of the released work. with. Thanks to Space Eight for making the design
available and being a valuable resource for custom pinball fabrication.
